## The Skills-Outcome Extraction and Comparison Tool
### Synopsis
The "Skills-Outcome Extraction and Comparison" software is a tool being developed to connect employers in-industry to students graduating from academia. The proposed tool will provide users with a platform to access a side-by-side comparison of classroom assessments and job posting requirements using techniques and methodologies from:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning (AI/ML)
- Data Analysis
- Data Mining

The algorithm used will analyze job postings and classroom assessments, extract and classify "skill units" within those corpuses, then compares sets of skills from different input volumes. This process effectively provides a predicted alignment between academic and career sources, both federal and industrial. 

### Results and Findings
The compilation of tool results indicates an overall accuracy score of 82%, and an alignment score of only 75.5% between the input assessments and overall job postings. These results describe that the 50 UNT assessments and 5,000 industry and federal job postings examined, demonstrate a compatibility (alignment) of 75.5%; and, that this measure was calculated using a tool operating at an 82% precision rate. In order to understand what employers are looking for, we can analyze employerâ€™s career pages and job postings. Those mediums are primary sources for identifying the required skills and knowledge that students need in order to work in those roles. From the scraping of website data, to keyword identification, and clustering and classification of skills -- this tool attempts to bridge the gap between potential employee and employer.
