You’ll work either in our North American Knowledge Center in Waltham, Massachusetts or in our hub in New York City, focusing on risk analytics as part of our Risk Dynamics team, part of McKinsey's global Risk practice.
Our global Risk practice supports clients in many different industries facing challenges of developing and implementing tailored concepts for risk recognition, measurement and control. Risk Dynamics is a global leader in model development, model risk management and independent validation. We solve clients' business issues with advanced analytics, our proposition to properly scope tech enablement transformations. We enhance our clients' decision-making and risk profile by helping them to efficiently manage their model landscape, mitigate their model limitations and optimize their risk models.
Risk Dynamics is a specialized team conducting in-depth validation and model risk advisory services for banks, asset managers, insurance firms and other leading financial institutions. These assessments require a rigorous understanding of both underlying modeling techniques and the overall business context in which such models are being used. Our model development, model validation and model risk advisory work spans multiple risk functions, markets, operating challenges and modeling techniques.
McKinsey fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for, and expands our investment in, our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
What You'll Do
You will complete targeted quantitative analyses and build components of advanced models across the spectrum of Risk management including prospecting, underwriting, portfolio monitoring, pricing, asset evaluation and loss mitigation.
You’ll work on client projects as an integral part of engagement teams and will also contribute to internal knowledge development initiatives. You’ll disaggregate and structure complex, often ambiguous, business problems and evaluate different analytical approaches to develop potential solutions. You will apply advanced analytic and quantitative tools, statistical modeling techniques and data mining procedures to derive business insights and solve complex business problems.
Further, you will deploy statistical modeling and optimization techniques most suited for the business problem (using Python, SAS, SQL, R and other relevant tools) to improve Risk management decision making (e.g. underwriting models). You will contribute to team problem solving through the findings and insights from your analysis and help facilitate data integration and management between clients and McKinsey. Ultimately, you will contribute to the development of knowledge for the analytic group at large.
You will work directly with clients to conduct a hands-on rigorous quantitative analysis including getting the data, cleaning it and exploring it for accuracy. Once data is transformed, you will deploy statistical modeling and optimization techniques most suited for the business problem (using Python, SAS, SQL, R and other relevant tools). You will advise client teams on analytic options to address their specific needs including discussing potential approaches to problems, associated costs, trade-offs and recommendations. You will interpret outputs of statistical models and results with the team to translate input from quantitative analyses into specific and actionable business recommendations. This includes providing detailed documentation of modeling techniques, methodologies and process steps.
You will balance independent modeling and analytical work with oversight of firm teammates including fellows and analysts (50/50 balance). You will also advance McKinsey’s overall knowledge base by providing analytical rigor and problem solving to our proprietary knowledge investments specifically in analytics or the domain area of your expertise.
Qualifications

3+ years of hands-on work experience using analytical tools (e.g. R, Python) to solve real world problems
Strong experience in and a desire to learn about risk management including operations risk, anti-money-laundering, fraud detection and credit risk
